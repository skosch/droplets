    \chapter[Monodisperse droplet generation]{Monodisperse\\droplet generation}
\label{sec:droplet-generator}

To calibrate any droplet sizing device, we need droplets of known and uniform
size. Sprays or streams of such uniform droplets are called \emph{monodisperse},
and many different varying approaches to generating them have been proposed,
each one with advantages and drawbacks.

The most basic type of droplet generator is a capillary tube, for instance a
hypodermic needle or a pulled glass pipette. Droplets are generated as the
liquid flows through the tube due to its own weight. As the liquid leaves the
tube, it wets the tip of the tube and forms a bead held together by surface
tension. Eventually, the bead's gravitational forces overcome the attraction to
the tube surface, and the drop separates from the tube.

Given a liquid and its physical properties, the only remaining controllable
variable is the diameter of the capillary tube tip. As a rule, droplets
generated in this fashion will be significantly larger than the tube diameter
from which they grow. Most droplet generators are designed to prevent this from
happening:
\begin{alist}
\item \emph{Aerodynamic} droplet generators use coaxial air flow to shear the
    forming droplet off of the capillary tip before it can grow to full size.
\item \emph{On-demand} droplet generators use a pressure pulse to eject a fixed
    amount of liquid out of the capillary (or other orifice).
\item \emph{Continuous-stream} droplet generators use mechanical vibrations to
    break up a continuous jet of liquid emanating from the capillary into
    monodisperse droplets.
\end{alist}
More exotic types of droplet generators exist: \citet{Walton49} suggested that
water falling on spinning disks is propelled outwards, forming nearly
monodisperse droplets, and several improved designs have been published since.
Another approach, e.g. used by \citet{Merritt77}, involves mechanized dipping of
a needle into a liquid reservoir, and then flicking it so as to produce one
droplet.

\section{Aerodynamic droplet generators}
\citet{Allan88} provide a history of aerodynamic designs: the first design was
published in 1947 by \citet{Lane47}; \citet{Reil69} later improved on it by
using time-controlled air pulses instead of a continous flow. Coggins and Baker
\cite{Coggins83} have proposed a more elaborate apparatus with variable air and liquid
flow and adjustable needle position.

\subsection{Stry design}
Initial tests based on a design by \citet{Stry92} showed that the ability of the
instrument to produce droplets below 600$\,\mu$m depends entirely on the
precision with which the flow of water and air can be controlled.
\begin{figure}

\caption{Schematic drawing of the coaxial-flow aerodynamic droplet generator,
based on \citet{Stry92}. Top: top view, right: rear view (third angle
projection). Sectional view illustrates operating principle.\label{fig:stry}}
\end{figure}

\section{On-demand drop generators}
Drop-on-demand technology finds its most important application in printing.
Indeed, the most prominent designs representative of this category are the thermal droplet
generators found in most household inkjet printers, invented by \citet{Endo88}.
At least one research group, \citet{Sergeyev06}, has succeeded in repurposing
an old inkjet print head for laboratory droplet generation.

Less widespread, but more flexible in a research setting, are on-demand
generators driven by the contraction of piezoelectric elements, such as those
proposed by \citet{Yang97} or \citet{Ulmke99}. Excellent reviews on
drop-on-demand designs were published by Le and Lee \cite{Le98, Lee02}. 

A curious third type of on-demand generator by \citet{Goghari08} uses a short
pulse of pressurized air, controlled by a solenoid valve, to eject a small
amount of liquid through an orifice.

While drop-on-demand generators are a crucial component in applications like inkjet
printing or microfluidics, they tend to suffer from aspired air bubbles, pileup
of liquid around the nozzle tip, clogging, and other issues thwarting reliable
drop expulsion unless manufactured and operated with great attention to detail.

\subsection{Amirzadeh Goghari and Chandra design}
We constructed a droplet generator based on the design by \citet{Goghari08}.
While both its construction from off-the-shelf parts and its operation are
remarkably straightforward, it has two limitations:

\begin{alist}
    \item the duration of the air pulse is limited by the response time of the
        solenoid valve used. The shortest pulse we were able to reliable produce
        was on the order of a few milliseconds, which did not permit us to
        produce droplets smaller than a few hundred microns in diameter, and
    \item the head of water over the orifice must be kept very low to prevent 
        leakage. As a result, the number of droplets that can be ejected is
        limited before the water needs to be replenished.
\end{alist}

Owed to our lack of access to an automatic micropipette puller, the nozzles used
in this experiment were not optimal, which likely contributed to our experience
of frequent satellite droplets and liquid buildup at the nozzle tip.

\subsection{Modified Yang design}
A popular piezoelectric-based drop-on-demand design was proposed by
\citet{Yang97}. It consists of a liquid-filled chamber, one wall of which is the
underside of a piezoelectric disk---a brass disk coated with a circular piece of
piezoelectric material, commonly found in electric buzzers.

To evaluate the performance of such a drop generator, we constructed several
modifications of it, the final one of which is shown in \figref{fig:flatyang}.
To make the chamber as flat as possible, minimizing the distance between
piezoelectric disk and orifice, it has a depth of only about 2.5$\,$mm, the
thickness of a sheet of acrylic. A second sheet holds the disk in place, while a
third sheet makes up the bottom wall of the chamber. Nozzle and inlet are glued
directly into the bottom sheet.

To operate the droplet generator, water is fed through
the inlet port until the chamber is filled and all air bubbles have escaped
through the upward-facing nozzle. The generator is then turned so that the nozzle
faces down and $30\,$ms pulses of about $30\,$V are delivered to the
piezoelectric disk.

The greatest challenge faced was the accumulation of liquid on the nozzle
surface, which quickly led to satellite droplets or thwarted droplet production
altogether.  % TODO: add detail about the different nozzle types we tried

Again, capillaries drawn with an automatic pipette puller are likely
more resistant to this effect.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/setup/flatyang_exploded.pdf}
\caption{Top and right: schematic cross-section and exploded view of our
    piezoelectric droplet generator. Bottom left: photomicrograph of the nozzle
    tip ejecting a column of water (diameter $\approx 125\,\mu$m), which is about to coalesce into a
round droplet. \label{fig:flatyang}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Piezo-based drop generator}
We tried building a Piezodropper from old piezoelectric elements squeezing glass
capillaries (just like in the Ulmke paper), but two of the piezo elements were
broken, and the third one had a capillary that clogged up repeatedly. We
abandoned the approach before building a functioning droplet generator, although
it seems attractive in practice. One downside is that the generation of
amplified signals isn't straightforward -- we used a soundcard connected to an
amplifier to generate the signals.

\section{Continuous-stream drop generation}
There exist continuous-stream drop generators based on coaxial air flow
\cite{Green89} and on,
but most continuous-stream drop generators are based on
\emph{Rayleigh breakup}, i.e. the disintegration of a disturbed liquid jet into
droplets. The physics behind this phenomenon have been studied for almost two
centuries \cite{Savart33, Rayleigh79} and are well-understood. When the jet
disturbances are induced by carefully controlled mechanical vibrations at an
appropriate frequency, the droplets will be of uniform size and evenly spaced.

This simple principle has been employed to generate droplets for fifty years,
with orifices typically attached to either one of two vibrating mechanisms: an
ordinary loudspeaker, first used by \citet{Donnelly66}, or
a piezoelectric element, as first proposed by \citet{Schneider64} and popularized by Berglund and Liu's
design \cite{Berglund73}.

\subsection{Speaker-based drop generator}
We used a big plastic underwater woofer, with a bendable metal strap taped to
the cone. The end of the metal strap touched and vibrated the nozzle. At large
droplet sizes, this is no problem at all, but once we get to about 1 kHz, the
amplitude needs to go up considerably to yield a reliable breakup. In practice,
this means that it gets very loud, jeopardizing the laboratory peace.

\subsection{Hard-drive based drop generator}
The accuracy of the hypodermic needle nozzle often isn't quite as good as that of e.g.
photofabricated nozzles, as those have sharp edges. The round edges lead to
variability in discharge coefficient (and mass flow), resulting in variance in
drop volume \cite{Dressler90}. Nevertheless, for the purpose of verifying the validity of
measurements, it'll do.

% TODO: write that the bulk of this section has been adapted from Kosch et al.,
% journal XYZ
Both speaker-based and piezo-based approaches have certain drawbacks: by design,
a speaker vibrating at a fixed pitch produces an audible sound, jeopardizing the
laboratory peace. Speakers are unshapely, difficult to fasten onto an
experimental setup and their cones provide no robust structure to which any type
of orifice could be attached. Piezoelectric elements cost more and are useful
only when integrated with the orifice---precision machined droplet generators
operating this way are commercially available, but unreasonably expensive in
many situations. As a result, we felt compelled to consider alternative sources
of vibration that require a minimum effort to build and install using standard
lab equipment, and chose the actuator mechanism found in every magnetic hard
drive for the following properties:

\paragraph*{Very low cost.} With high-capacity and solid-state devices rapidly pushing older hard drives
into obsolescence, it should be a simple matter to acquire a few decommissioned specimens for
demolition. Hard drives come in two form factors---3.5 and 2.5 inches wide,
respectively---and both can be used for the purposes of this paper. 

Further, glass needle orifices fabricated for use with existing loudspeaker
setups can be reused, and are easily produced by hand from heated borosilicate
capillaries or using a micropipette puller. The process is illustrated in
\figref{fig:needles} and in-depth instructions are given by Lee\cite{Lee02}.
Piezoelectric-based devices, on the other hand, need fitted orifices to produce
a range of drop sizes.

\paragraph*{Ease of construction and installation.} Unlike loudspeakers, hard
drives have a flat base plate which can be drilled into, allowing for easy
installation on any experiment jig. Save for a drill and a saw, no machining
tools are needed for the construction of the droplet generator.

\paragraph*{High amplitudes without noise.}
Like piezoelectric elements, vibrating actuator arms are very quiet, enabling
use at frequencies and amplitudes that would far exceed responsible levels on
a speaker.  In our experiments, the actuator responded to frequencies throughout
our hearing range---i.e., up to $17\,$kHz---and likely well beyond, though we
have not tested the full response range for any given amplitude.

As an added advantage over other designs, no amplification is needed. Below
$100\,$Hz, amplitudes on the order of $0.5\,$cm are easily achieved (albeit they
are of course not needed for droplet production) when a peak-to-peak voltage of
$2-4\,$V is applied. The amplitude scales down with the inverse of the frequency,
however, such that amplitudes are much smaller at typical operating frequencies
($0.5-10\,$kHz). Nevertheless, the voltages required are well within the ability
of any standard laboratory function generator, and can likely even produced by many
consumer-level computer sound cards.

\subsubsection{Operating principle}
Magnetic hard drives store data as sub-micron-sized patterns of 
oppositely magnetized dots on disks called \emph{platters}. The read-write head
is mounted at the tip of an arm that pivots across the platter surface while the
platter spins. This setup allows the head to access the entire platter surface.

\figref{fig:designschematic} illustrates schematically the design of a typical
actuator arm assembly. The flat voice coil mounted on the surface is responsible
for the arm's side-to-side movement: as it is positioned under a permanent
magnet, the coil creates a sideward force when a current flows through its
wires. By stopping or reversing the current the arm's motion is likewise stopped
or reversed. Since a typical hard drive's platter spins at up to $7200\,$RPM,
actuator arms must be able to move with extreme speed and precision. They are
thus engineered to be very light yet stiff. These characteristics make a
magnetic hard drive's actuator arm an ideal supplier of in-plane vibrations.
Indeed, hard drive actuators are remarkable not for their operating principle
but for their low cost; it is only the economics of mass manufacturing that has
in recent years enabled these high-speed, lightweight precision mechanisms to
become so widely available.

\subsubsection{Construction}

$200\,\mu$m), overheated (I.D. $0\,\mu$m). \label{fig:needles}}
\end{wrapfigure}
If possible, forgo multi-platter drives, as they are more cumbersome to disassemble and have
bulky, complex actuator assemblies. The device shown in \figref{fig:harddrive-photo}
is based on a single-platter drive.

\paragraph{Dismantle and cut.} After removing the hard drive cover, remove
the magnet holder, arm axis, arm, ribbon wires, circuit boards, and platters
such that only the base plate remains. Now the corner of the base plate holding
the actuator arm assembly can be cut out to yield the result shown in
\figref{fig:designschematic}. A band saw, jigsaw or powered hacksaw will be
very useful, although not necessary. The goal is to allow the tip of the arm to
protrude over the edge.

\paragraph{Expose coil leads.} Next, remove the read/write head and all
wiring leading to it, along with any connected I/O and servo circuitry. Be
careful, however, not to tear off the two strands powering the voice coil. If
they are integrated in a ribbon you wish to remove, ensure that exposed
terminals remain onto which you can solder new leads.

        plate, actuator arm, axis, and magnet assembly; (b) assembled droplet
    generator with cover plate and nozzle inserted through actuator arm.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Add protective cover.} We recommend bolting on a cover plate, such
as a small sheet of acrylic or polycarbonate, to protect the protruding arm from
accidental bending. Drill a hole through the cover to allow the nozzle to be
threaded through the arm. A severable
connection from coil to function generator is preferable to a direct wire, if
only because the voice coil leads are delicate and easily torn off. To this end, we epoxied
an audio jack into the cover and soldered the voice coil leads to it from the
bottom. 

\subsubsection{Operation}
To use the droplet generator, simply insert a nozzle through a small hole at the
tip of the actuator arm---typically at least one hole will already be present, but you may wish to drill
more---and connect the voice coil leads to the output terminal of a function
generator set to an initial peak-to-peak voltage of $1\,$V and a sinusoid frequency of
about $50\,$Hz, which should cause weak but perceptible oscillations.


We used existing nozzles manufactured by hand from hypodermic needle stubs and
heated glass capillaries (\figref{fig:needles}). We make no claim that this is
the best approach to take, but we note that the interchangeability of nozzles
with Luer fittings has proved very convenient in our application. How the nozzle
can be held in place falls beyond the scope of this article; while we used an
existing setup made from machined aluminum, a small lab stand and clamp should
suffice to hold the male Luer fitting connecting the feed tube to the nozzle.

The nozzle must be supplied by an accurately calibrated syringe pump. It is
convenient to integrate a large liquid reservoir (or tap water hose) via a
T-valve between the between pump and nozzle to permit quick topping up of the
syringe. In such a setup ensure that the reservoir valve is shut closed before operation,
since pressure fluctuations at the nozzle are the most common culprit for
unstable jet breakup conditions.

As with other vibrating orifice droplet generators, it is crucial that stable
conditions are established before any experiments can begin. First, confirm that
the liquid is ejected in a single jet. Multiple jets can be due to a clogged
orifice (a mixture of distilled water and CLR®, drawn back through a
syringe, is an excellent remedy). Satellite droplets can also form secondary
jets, in which case the oscillation frequency must be adjusted or the amplitude
reduced. Satellite formation is easily detected by using a gentle air flow to
deflect the jet---if the droplets are truly monodisperse, they will all deflect
at the same angle.\cite{Strom69}


\section{Determining the produced droplet size}
With droplet generators based on Rayleigh breakup, such as the HDG, this is easy
to do; just take the flow rate and divide by the number of droplets produced per
second (which, under stable conditions, equals the vibration frequency as each
instability turns into one droplet). If we assume perfect sphericity, we can
convert this droplet volume into a diameter. After cancelling terms, the
expression for $D_d$ becomes
\begin{equation}
    D_{d} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{6Q}{\pi f}}\label{eq:dropdia-continuous}
\end{equation}

The reliablity of the underlying assumption has been verified photographically
for several different nozzle orifice diameters and frequencies, some of which
are given as part of the ILIDS calibration.

\subsection{Photographing droplets}
With drop-on-demand approaches, the diameter of the produced droplet is more
difficult to predict, particularly since not the whole squeezing volume may
result in ejected liquid (e.g. with the Chandra generator, it's just a small
droplet). So to find out how big these droplets are (or just to verify the accuracy of
Eq.~\eqref{eq:dropdia-continuous}), we must resort to photographic means.

While there are different methods of photographing droplets, just taking
pictures in front of a strobe light has worked well.

We used a scale placed next to the droplet stream, and then used a conversion
between pixels to find the size. Of course, this method suffers from barrel
distortion that inevitably happens, especially with a zoom lens. 
% TODO: measure the barrel distortion.
\begin{wrapfigure}[19]{L}{0.4\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{papers/hdg_images/photo.eps}
\caption{Photographs of different droplet sizes ($220\,\mu$m and $386\,\mu$m,
    $f=1.990\,$kHz and $1.065\,$kHz respectively) produced with the droplet
generator shown in \figref{fig:hdg-photo}. Scales have been cropped out.
\label{fig:hdg-dropphoto}}
\end{wrapfigure}
Figure X shows a typical droplet stream photo (at different sizes).

\subsection{Droplet collisions}
\label{sec:droplet-collisions}
No droplet generation mechanism is perfect. Small fluctuations in flow rate,
unwanted harmonic vibrations and air turbulence can cause disturbances in the
stream of evenly spaced droplets -- the smaller the droplets, the more often
this happens. Occasionally, this will lead to the collision
of two droplets some distance away from the orifice.

When two drops of diameter $D_d$ collide, the diameter of the new droplet equals
\begin{equation}
    D_{d+d} = 2\sqrt[3]{2\left(\frac{D_d}{2}\right)^3} = \sqrt[3]{2} D_d \approx
    1.26 D_d.
\end{equation}

Indeed, secondary peaks will often appear in diameter histograms at precisely 126\% of
the peak diameter. As long as the underlying phenomenon is understood and kept
under control, these secondary peaks should be no cause for concern during the
calibration. Typically, photographs will confirm that a few droplets go astray
and collide with others. Since the ``real'' diameter peaks are easily discerned,
the secondary peaks can simply be ignored.

\chapter[ILIDS]{ILIDS}
Interferometric Laser Imaging for Droplet Sizing (ILIDS), also known as
Interferometric Particle Imaging (IPI) and MSI (Mie Scattering Imaging) is an
optical droplet sizing method in which a spray is illuminated by a sheet of
laser light and the scattered light is imaged laterally. The laser light is both
reflected and refracted by the droplets, such that each droplet produces a pair
of apparent ``glare points''. When seen through a lens away from the focal
plane, each pair of glare points---being sources of coherent monochromatic
light---appears as an interference pattern which, after falling through a
circular aperture, casts an image that is a circular disk of fringes.  The
spatial frequency of the fringes is (to a very close approximation) linearly
related to the particle size. The phenomenon was first described by
\citet{Konig86} and later in greater detail by \citet{Glover95}. Turnkey ILIDS
setups for spray characteriziation are now widely available, comprising
typically a pulsed Nd:YAG-laser, one or two CCD cameras, a timing circuit, and a
piece of image processing software.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/setup/ipi_setup_simple.pdf}
\caption{Perpendicular ($\phi=90^\circ$), single-camera ILIDS setup
\label{fig:ipi-setup-simple}}
\end{figure}
\section{Operating principle}
The number of fringes $N_\text{fr}$ appearing in the image has a simple linear relationship to
the droplet diametre $D_d$:
\nomenclature{$N_\text{fr}$}{Number of fringes}
\nomenclature{$\kappa$}{Scalar value relating the fringe count $N_\text{fr}$ to
the physical diameter of the particle $D_d$}
\nomenclature{$D_d$}{Physical diameter of the particle (here: droplet)}
\begin{equation}
    N_\text{fr} = \kappa D_d,
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ is a constant derived from the optical configuration:
\begin{equation}
    \kappa = \frac{\arcsin\left(\frac{D_a}{2z}\right)}{\lambda}
    \left(\cos\frac{\phi}{2} - \frac{m \sin\frac{\phi}{2}}{\sqrt{m^2 + 1 -
    2m\cos \frac{\phi}{2}}}\right).
    \label{kappa}
\end{equation}

In the above expression $D_a$ is the aperture diametre, $z$ is the distance of
the lens to the laser sheet, $\phi$ is the off-axis angle (90 degrees in most
setups, including ours), and $m$ is the relative refractive index of the
droplets (1.333 for water in air).

As a consequence of geometrical optics, the distance $s_x$ (in pixels) between two
adjacent fringes has a linear relationship with the defocussing distance $\Delta
z$, where $M$ is the magnification, $d_{p,x}$ is the physical size of a
camera sensor pixel, and $\Delta \theta$ is the angle subtended by two adjacent
fringes entering the lens \cite{Pan06}:
\nomenclature{$\Delta \theta$}{Angular spacing between two adjacent fringes}
\nomenclature{$\Delta z$}{Distance along the $z$-axis between the focal plane of
the lens and the light sheet}
\nomenclature{$M$}{Magnification}
\nomenclature{$s_x$}{Distance, in pixels, between two adjacent fringes}
\nomenclature{$d_{p,x}; d_{p,y}$}{Physical dimensions of a pixel on the camera's
CCD sensor}
\begin{equation}
  s_x = \frac{\Delta \theta \Delta z}{M d_{p,x}} 
  \label{fringedistance-pixels}
\end{equation}
Of course, equation \eqref{fringedistance-pixels} is only meaningful where $\Delta z \gg
0$. When the image is brought into focus ($z\approx 0$), fringes will give way to a sharp
image of the glare points.\footnote{To be exact, diffraction will
cause every point to be imaged as an Airy disk, but we shall neglect
this effect here.} Of course, if the pixel density is too low to resolve
both glare points, a single bright spot will appear. 

\subsection{Influence of the scattering angle $\phi$}
The scattering angle $\phi$, illustrated in \figref{fig:droplet-rays}, determines the
relative contribution of different scattering orders of light to the imaged
fringe pattern. Both geometric optics \cite{Vandehulst12} and Mie theory provide
methods to compute the total scattered intensity for a given $\phi$ and $m$;
some examples can be found in \citet{Kawaguchi02} and \citet{Mounaim99}. The
geometric analysis approach is not valid beyond $\phi > 70^\circ$, as the
first-order scattered beam ($p=1$) is not visible from this angle
\cite{Glover95}.

\begin{wrapfigure}[14]{R}{0.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/setup/droplet_rays.pdf}
\caption{Reflected and first-order-refracted light rays, producing two glare
points when viewed from an angle $\phi$. \label{fig:droplet-rays}}
\end{wrapfigure}

While authors have identified several forward angles as optimal for their
applications, e.g. $\phi = 45^\circ$ \cite{Glover95} or $\phi = 66^\circ$
\cite{Mounaim99}, such configurations inevitably result in a variation in $z$,
and therefore defocusing, across the image unless the
camera itself is angled with respect to the lens to correct for this aberration
(the so-called \emph{Scheimpflug condition}). Since the latter approach requires
specialized optical equipment, $\phi = 90^\circ$ is used in many setups,
including the one in this paper.

\subsection{Optical limits on fringe detection}
\label{sec:ipi-fringelimits}
Optics impose theoretical and practical size limits on the droplets to be
measured. We will outline them in the following paragraphs; the reader is
referred to \citet{Damaschke02} for a more detailed analysis.

\paragraph{Nyquist criterion for the fringe density.}
The Nyquist criterion requires that for the camera to be able to resolve a pair
of neighbouring fringes, their images must be at least two pixels apart. This
can easily be achieved by a sufficient defocusing the lens, which widens the
fringe image, increasing the number of pixels covered by each fringe. The lens
mechanics permitting, any arbitrarily large droplet can thus be measured after a
quick adjustment. In theory, this correction is effective until the defocused
droplet image is too large for the CCD sensor, and fringes are cut off. In
practice, overlap and noise (see below) will cause significant problems long
before the image can be defocussed beyond the sensor edges.

\paragraph{Signal-to-noise ratio.}
Image noise is a significant source of trouble in ILIDS analysis. Indeed, many
droplet images must be discarded as data sources because they are too weak
compared to the noise.
Small droplets suffer from this more than larger ones because they scatter less
light,\footnote{The scattered intensity grows with the cross-section of the
droplet} but the problem also occurs with deeply out-of-focus images of very large
droplets, as dilated droplet images spread the same amount of light over a
greater area on the camera sensor. As a result, they are darker on average than
less defocused images. 

\paragraph{Minimum droplet size.}
\citet{Damaschke02} argue that the smallest measurable droplet is one that
produces exactly one fringe falling through the aperture. We may speculate that, at least
in theory, the fringe frequency should be measurable even if only a partial
fringe is shown. This would require its image to be sufficiently zero-padded
before the Fourier transform is applied to it. In practice, however, the
intensity of scattered light typically drops below an acceptable level well before
the fringes become too large, and noise (see above) will become the overwhelming
problem.

\paragraph{Deviation from actual Mie scattering for small droplet sizes.}
ILIDS users should also be aware that the assumptions of geometric optics
that underlie \eqref{kappa} do not hold for small droplets. \citet{Mounaim99}
found that for isooctane droplets ($m=1.39$) below $10\,\mu$m, geometric optics
yield a fringe spacing value about 14\% higher than that predicted by exact Mie
scattering simulations at $\lambda=532\,$nm. While the deviation quickly
vanishes for larger droplets, it is nevertheless noteworthy in the context of
potential error sources.

\paragraph{Overlapping droplet images.}
The ability to image a whole 2D field of droplets all at once is ILIDS' strongest
selling point, yet also its curse. When droplets are spaced too closely and the
lens is sufficiently defocused, the defocused disk images overlap and it becomes
difficult to determine the fringe counts corresponding to individual droplets.
\citet{Damaschke02} provide a statistical estimate on the fraction of
overlapping disks (overlap coefficient). 


\section{Types of ILIDS setups}
\label{sec:ipi-setup}
\subsection{Standard ILIDS}
The most simple ILIDS configuration, as shown in \figref{fig:ipi-setup-simple},
consists of a single digital camera with a defocused objective lens, placed at a right
angle to the laser sheet. The lens aperture is (approximately) circular and
typically completely open to permit as much light as possible to fall on the
sensor area.

Both camera and laser are connected to a computer via a timing circuit, and both
can be triggered simultaneously by software installed on the computer.
Commercial ILIDS vendors provide the timing circuitry and the software, which
typically integrates a collection of image processing algorithms that can be
used to analyze the captured images immediately.

The core problem with all ILIDS setups is the determination of $z$ and $d_a$ in
\eqref{kappa}.  We will discuss calibration of ILIDS systems in greater detail in
\secref{} calibration.

Images taken in this configuration are very susceptible to excessive
disk overlap.


Therefore, measures have been developed to sidestep overlap
almost entirely or to deal with it during the image processing stage. These
modifications will be described in the next sections.

\subsection{ILIDS with optical compression}
This problem is never more apparent than in efforts to calibrate
the system using a vibrating orifice droplet generator, as the droplets produced
thereby are spaced very closely and produce heavily overlapping defocussed
images. Fortunately, there exists a simple and reliable technique to deal with
this problem: a slit aperture, installed directly in front of the lens, masks
the defocussed droplet images such that only a thin strip across their center
passes through the lens. The effect is shown in \figref{fig:globalsizing}. 

Arguably the most popular way to reduce the amount of overlap is the use of
optical compression techniques, whether by means of a slit aperture \cite{Pan06}
or a cylindrical lens \cite{Kawaguchi02, Maeda02}. However, some techniques
(e.g. Global Phase-Doppler \cite{Damaschke01} and intensity-analyzing
methods \cite{Querel10}) or use cases (e.g. very low signal-to-noise ratios)
require the full disk image to be available. In these cases, the standard
approach is to identify the location and outline of each disk image, such that
the fringe analysis can either be limited to non-overlapping regions or be
otherwise modified to take overlapping fringes into account.

Naturally, equations \eqref{kappa} and \eqref{fringedistance-pixels} still hold.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    stop pares off the top and bottom halves of the defocussed circles, leaving
only a narrow center string in the middle.}
    \label{fig:globalsizing}
\end{figure}
Also mention that this can be used in conjecture with an additional, focused
camera, to capture things like speed (PIV), evaporation (PLIF), etc. Why we
don't need it.

Extracting the fringe counts from such an image is straightforward. First, we
correlate the image with that of a single, solid bright rectangle which shares
the approximate dimensions of a typical strip in the image. This operation
yields intensity
peaks centered over our regions of interest. We remove closely adjacent peaks,
as they may represent questionable or overlapping strips. Compared to the sheer
number of correctly identified strips, the number of legitimate data points lost
this way is negligible. \figref{fig:globalsizing-identifystrips} shows the
result of such an attempt at identifying the strips.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.38\textheight]{img/globalsizing-identifystrips.png}
    \caption{The image is correlated with that of a solid bright rectangle, which
        results in peaks that approximately coincide with the centers of the
        strips. Here, the original photo is shown with rectangles drawn centered
    at said peaks.}
    \label{fig:globalsizing-identifystrips}
\end{figure}

To find the number of fringes within the strip, we cannot rely on counting the
number of dark/bright variations directly, as some of them may be lost in the
noise. The spatial frequency of the peaks, however, taken together with the
known and constant horizontal width of the strips, will produce a reliable
fringe count. In the next step, our algorithm therefore applies the Fourier
transform to each region of interest. To improve the accuracy of the method,
three steps are performed before the Fourier transform is taken:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a weak ($3 \times 3$) Gaussian blur is applied to the region
        (optional);
    \item a Hanning window is applied to the region -- both horizontally and
        vertically. This reduces the ``sinc ringing'' effect encountered when
        taking the Fourier transform of finite signals;
    \item the region is padded with zeros in all directions to yield a larger
        input to the Fourier transform. In our application, the windowed and padded strip
        images had dimensions of $1024 \times 1024$ pixels. Zero-padding
        increases the granularity of the frequency spectrum, which can help with
        the correct identification of the peak frequency.
\end{enumerate}

\figref{fig:globalsizing-dropletpeak} shows the windowed appearance of
one such region of interest (although it does not show the padded input to the
Fourier transform due to space constraints). The Fourier transform yields a
frequency power spectrum in two dimensions, although we are primarily interested
in the frequency peak in the horizontal direction (i.e. along $y=0$). In order
to minimize the misidentification of dominant frequencies,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item we clip the spectrum to a band of reasonable frequencies. This is
        necessary because a) $1/f$-noise causes very low frequencies to dominate
        in power, although they are of no interest to us, and b) graininess in
        the original photo can sometimes result in meritless high-frequency
        peaks;
    \item we apply a Gaussian blur to the 2D spectrum to remove outliers in the
        spectrum;
    \item we discard all regions in which the peak frequency's power does not
        exceed a certain value;
    \item we discard all regions in which the \textit{prominence} of the peak
        freqency's power (i.e. its proportion to the mean power) does not exceed
        a certain value (this step is optional).
\end{enumerate}
The bottom two elements in \figref{fig:globalsizing-dropletpeak} illustrate
the effect of these steps.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.38\textheight]{img/globalsizing-dropletpeak.png}
    \caption{From top to bottom: windowed region of interest; original
    (unwindowed) region of interest; sine wave representing the identified peak
frequency; clipped and lowpass-filtered 2D frequency spectrum showing a distinct
peak at about 90 oscillations across the image width of 1024 pixels; 1D plot of
the frequency spectrum, with peak identified at $f=91.0$.}
    \label{fig:globalsizing-dropletpeak}
\end{figure}

\begin{wrapfigure}[12]{R}{0.4\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{img/dropletslitcropping2.jpg}
    \caption{Only a slit aperture centered on the lens and extending across the
    entire lens entrance will preserve all fringes \label{fig:droplet-slitcropping}}
\end{wrapfigure}
Finally, the peak frequency $f_\text{peak}$ is converted into a fringe count by re-scaling it
from the padded size $D_\text{padded}\, (= 1024$ pixels) to the width of the strip (which, in the
context of IPI measurements, should equal the diameter $D_\text{i}$ of the defocussed droplet
image):
\nomenclature{$f_\text{peak}$}{Peak frequency}
\nomenclature{$D_\text{i}$}{Diameter (in pixels) of the defocussed image}
\nomenclature{$D_\text{padded}$}{Width (in pixels) of the padded input to the
Fourier transform}
\begin{equation}
    N_\text{fr} = f_\text{peak} \frac{D_\text{i}}{D_\text{padded}}
    \label{fringes-from-diameter}
\end{equation}

While the above algorithm will generally give a good estimate of the fringe
count for a given defocussed droplet image, it cannot know whether the entire
center portion of the image has indeed passed the slit aperture. It is
conceivable, after all, that the slit aperture was not perfectly centered on the
lens entrance, or that the slit aperture was shorter than the diameter of the
lens entrance. \figref{fig:droplet-slitcropping} illustrates how the slit
aperture can cause the defocussed image to appear smaller than it is. The
reduced value for $D_\text{i}$, manually entered in equation
\eqref{fringes-from-diameter}, will result
in droplets being reported as smaller than they are in reality.

As noted above, ILIDS with optical compression can be used with an additional,
focused camera behind a beam splitter, as shown in
\figref{fig:ipi-setup-double}.\footnote{Alternatively, the two cameras may image
    the spray from different angles, e.g. as demonstrated by \citet{Glover95},
    although this complicates the setup as the Scheimpflug condition must be
fulfilled.} The latter may provide e.g. PIV images for a
velocity analysis or LIF images for evaporation studies. This was demonstrated
by \citet{Hardalupas10} and \citet{Hardalupas10a}. However, such setups suffer
from \emph{center discrepancies}. \secref{sec:point-set-registration} documents
how such center discrepancies can be dealt with.

\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/setup/ipi_setup_double.pdf}
\caption{Perpendicular ($\phi=90^\circ$), double-camera ILIDS setup}
\label{fig:ipi-setup-double}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Additional focused image for disk detection}
As described above, running a simple frequency analysis on bright regions in an
ILIDS image is futile when two of the fringe disks overlap, as it is not clear
how many droplets are associated with the region and where their disks infringe.
While optical compression provides a very good solution to this problem, it is
not always applicable: some techniques (e.g. Global
Phase-Doppler \cite{Damaschke01} and intensity-analyzing methods \cite{Querel10})
or use cases (e.g. very low signal-to-noise ratios) require the full disk image
to be available. In these cases, the standard approach is to identify the
location and outline of each disk image, such that the fringe analysis can
either be limited to non-overlapping regions or be otherwise modified to take
overlapping fringes into account. Additionally, once disk centers are found, the
software can apply Hanning windows to the disks as well as ignore disk pairs
that are too close.\footnote{The latter is an effective control mechanism, but
    is liable to skew the representativeness of the sample because small,
dispersed satellites outside of the main flow are most likely to be validated.}

To identify the location of overlapping disks in the image, an additional camera
is introduced to capture a focused image of the spray simultaneously with the
defocused ILIDS camera. The setup is identical to that shown in
\figref{fig:ipi-setup-double}. The intensity peaks in the focused image are then taken
to be the droplet positions (i.e. disk centers) in the defocused image.

The problem with this, as with all multi-camera setups, are center
discrepancies. We show how to overcome that in
\secref{sec:keypoint-registration}.

\section{Calibrating the slit method}
What matters is the Numerical Aperture (NA), which is (the sine of half of) the
collection angle. When we have a simple lens, we can calculate this as
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{NA} = \sin \frac{d_a}{2z}
\end{equation}

The Dantec manual suggests using the distance from light sheet to front of the
lens for $z$, and the ratio of min focal length and max f-number to find $d_a$.
This, however, does not result in an accurate value for the collection angle
with all lenses.

We are assuming, then, that the effective aperture (the entrance pupil) always
stays constant throughout the focussing range of the lens. This is not
necessarily the case, as there are lenses which change both the physical and the
virtual size of the aperture when focussing.

Here is where I make the claim that it is impossible to determine the actual
exact value for the numerical aperture of the lens. Similarly, it can be quite
difficult to determine the accurate distance from light sheet to lens aperture
(even though the latter measurement is more forgiving, since the distances are
far greater).

Taking into account the sources of errors explained in the sections above, it is
advisable to run a few calibration tests with droplets of different sizes before
employing the IPI technique for real spray measurements. Recall that, if we
ignore the Mie error (\secref{sec:mie-error}), the relationship between fringe count and droplet diameter
is linear with a constant of proportionality $\kappa$ (see equation
\eqref{kappa}). The aim of our calibration, then, is to determine the value of
$\kappa$ from experiment -- the premise being that we cannot be certain of the
values of $D_a$, $z$, and possibly not even $m$ and $\phi$ (although the latter
can usually be ascertained to a sufficient degree of accuracy).

\subsection{A sample calibration of the slit aperture method}
Using the droplet generator described in \secref{sec:droplet-generator} and
the IPI configuration described in \secref{sec:ipi-setup}, we produced and
measured monodisperse droplets of many different diameters. The droplet
diameters were determined both mathematically and photographically, as described
in \secref{sec:verify-droplet-diameters}. Out of over 30 sets of IPI
measurements we selected six sets that exhibited both strong uniformity and
high photographic quality:

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
    \toprule
    Set & Flow rate & Frequency & $D_d$, predicted  & $D_d$, from
photo & $\hat{N}_\text{fr}$ \\
    \midrule
    FA & 20.8  ml/h  & 5395 Hz  & 127 $\mu$m  & 126 $\mu$m &  9.71      \\
    FB & 39.7  ml/h  & 1990 Hz  & 220 $\mu$m  & 226 $\mu$m &  16.71     \\
    FC & 79.4  ml/h  & 1565 Hz  & 299 $\mu$m  & 291 $\mu$m &  22.92     \\

    FF & 175.2 ml/h  & 1038 Hz  & 447 $\mu$m  & 454 $\mu$m &  34.56     \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Six sets of calibration data taken with the setup described in \secref{sec:ipi-setup}}
\label{tab:ipi-calibration-datasets}
\end{table}
\nomenclature{$\hat{N}_\text{fr}$}{Peak fringe count measured}
The values for $\hat{N}_\text{fr}$, the peak fringe count, are based on the
histograms (see \figref{fig:fringe-histograms}) showing the distribution of
fringe counts within each dataset. These fringe counts are of course found by
the algorithm described in \secref{sec:ipi-slitprocessing}.

It is worthwhile to point out some apparent idiosyncrasies in the histograms of
datasets FB and FC. Their peak fringe counts are 16.71 and 22.92, but there are
secondary peaks at about 21 and 29 fringes, respectively. The latter are
explained by the collision of droplets as discussed in
\secref{sec:droplet-collisions}, and are ignored for the purposes of
calibration.

\begin{sidewaysfigure}[p]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/fringe_histogram.pdf}
    \caption{Normalized distributions of measured fringe counts $N_\text{fr}$
        for the six datasets listed in \tableref{tab:ipi-calibration-datasets}. Solid lines are
Gaussian kernel density estimates with $h=0.5$. }
    \label{fig:fringe-histograms}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

The close agreement of the droplet diameters found from photographs with those
predicted by \eqref{berglund} reassures us that we can use the predicted $D_d$
for further analysis.

At this point, we can least-squares-fit the linear relationship \eqref{kappa} to the primary
peaks $\hat{N}_\text{fr}$ and the known droplet diameters $D_d$ to find
$\hat{\kappa}$:

\begin{equation}
    \hat{\kappa} = \frac{\sum_i D_{d,i} \, \hat{N}_{\text{fr}, i}}{\sum_i
    D_{d,i}^2}
\end{equation}

Note that instead of the standard least squares regression we here use a
simplified formula to force the trend line through the origin. This choice
should not be made lightly, since it will usually cause the residuals to have a
non-zero mean. In this case, however, we believe it to be justified to require
that $D_d = 0$ for $N_\text{fr} = 0$.

Based on the values in \tableref{tab:ipi-calibration-datasets}, we thus arrive
at a value of $\hat{\kappa} = 76808.1$ with an $R^2$-value of 99.98\%. 

\figref{fig:fringe-regression} illustrates the good agreement on $\kappa$ between
all datasets. Considering the sheer number of error sources -- from the
unavoidable non-uniformity of the generated droplets to the uncertainty that
comes with taking the Fourier transform of a noisy image -- the calibration
results documented here are a testament to the practical robustness of the
method.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/fringe_regression.pdf}
    \caption{Scatterplot of \tableref{tab:ipi-calibration-datasets} showing the peak fringe counts $\hat{N}_\text{fr}$ for each predicted droplet diameter $D_d$}
    \label{fig:fringe-regression}
\end{figure}
It must be remembered, of course, that the peak fringe count values
$\hat{N}_\text{fr}$ forming the basis of our calculation are taken from the
peaks of Gaussians fitted to the raw fringe count histograms (see
\figref{fig:fringe-histograms}. In other words, it is our assumption that all
droplets from a given dataset produce fringe counts that are normally
distributed around their respective $\hat{N}_\text{fr}$. The histogram to
dataset FA shows a much higher deviation than the others -- this may be due to
genuine variance in the generated droplet diameters or to difficulty in
processing comparatively weak images with low fringe counts. It seems likely
that both effects contribute.

We can compare the empirically determined value $\hat{\kappa}$ with the
mathematical result obtained from \eqref{kappa}. Substituting $\lambda = 532$
nm, $m = 1.3324$ and $\phi = 90^\circ$, we conclude that
\begin{equation}
    \frac{D_a}{z} = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\hat{\kappa} \lambda}{\cos
    \frac{\phi}{2} - \frac{ m \sin \frac{\phi}{2}}{\sqrt{m^2 + 1 - 2m \cos
    \frac{\phi}{2}}}} \right) = 2\sin (3.11982 \cdot 10^{-7} \hat{\kappa})
\end{equation}
so for $\hat{\kappa} = 76808.1$, $\frac{D_a}{z} = 0.047921$. Recall that this
quotient is a measure of the collection angle and closely related to the
numerical aperture NA$=\sin \frac{D_a}{2z}$. If needed, we can now use this
result to compute the input parameters $D_a$ and $z$ in the DantecStudio IPI
software: given, for instance, $z = 45.0$ cm, we can obtain the entrace pupil
diameter as
\begin{equation}
    0.047921~\cdot~450\,\mathrm{mm} = 2.156\,\mathrm{mm}
\end{equation}


\section{Removing center discrepancies with keypoint registration}
\label{sec:keypoint-registration}

%TODO: Say that the bulk of the following work is from Kosch and Ashgriz,
%submitted to journal/conference XYZ
As mentioned above, to allow both cameras to image the same physical region in
the spray, they are either placed behind a beamsplitter at a right angle to the
light sheet, or placed separately at different angles. The latter approach makes
for a more difficult setup, since Scheimpflug's rule demands that the camera
must be tilted with respect to the objective lens, but it gives the user the
freedom to choose the highest-intensity scattering angle.

In any of the above cases, the use of two cameras requires that their images be
mapped onto one another. This is commonly achieved by means of a camera
calibration procedure, in which a target pattern (e.g. as in \figref{fig:plate-calibration}) of known dimensions is
photographed by each camera. A pattern recognition algorithm then determines the
object-to-image mappings for each camera:


\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c} x'\\ y'\\ z'\\ r' \end{array} \right]
=
\left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
S_x & A_{yx} & A_{zx} & T_x \\
A_{xy} & S_y & A_{zy} & T_y \\
A_{xz} & A_{xy} & S_z & T_z \\
P_x & P_y & P_z & S_0
\end{array} \right]
\left[ \begin{array}{c} x\\ y \\ z \\ 1 \end{array} \right].
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.45\textheight]{img/orb/plate-calibration.jpg}
    \caption{Homography $\mathbf{H}$ applied to target pattern image captured by
        the focused camera and superimposed on the image captured by the
        defocused camera (here, both cameras were in focus for the calibration
        only).
    \label{fig:plate-calibration}}
\end{figure}

In our case, Dantec supplied a \emph{standard dot target}, a white $10 \times 10\,
\mathrm{cm}^2$ plate engraved with a pattern of black dots. The plate is to be
mounted such that its surface coincides perfectly with the laser sheet. 

In practice, $P_{x,y,z} = 0$ and $S_0 = 1$ is assumed, such that the mapping is
affine. The $z$-components (third row/column) are further assumed to be zero,
such that a $3 \times 3$ matrix suffices for the purposes of this discussion:
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c} x'\\ y'\\ r' \end{array} \right]
=
\left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
S_x & A_{yx} &  T_x \\
A_{xy} & S_y &  T_y \\
P_x & P_y & S_0
\end{array} \right]
\left[ \begin{array}{c} x\\ y \\ 1 \end{array} \right].
\end{equation}

The calibration algorithm thus finds the camera matrices
$\mathbf{P}_\text{foc}$ and $\mathbf{P}_\text{def}$ mapping the
object coordinates $\mathbf{x}$ onto the two camera images
$\mathbf{x}_\text{foc}'$ and $\mathbf{x}_\text{def}'$ (the respective 
    subscripts shall hence designate the focused and defocused
    cameras):
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{x}_\text{foc}' &= \mathbf{P}_\text{foc} \, \mathbf{x} \\
    \mathbf{x}_\text{def}' &= \mathbf{P}_\text{def} \, \mathbf{x}.
\end{align}

It follows that the quotient of the two matrices, also known as the homography
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{P}_\text{def} \, \mathbf{P}_\text{foc}^{-1}
\end{equation}
can be used to map the focused image onto the defocused image, as shown in \figref{fig:plate-calibration}:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{H}\, \mathbf{x}_\text{foc}' = \mathbf{x}_\text{def}'.
    \label{homography-definition}
\end{equation}
Unfortunately, the calibration procedure itself introduces an unwanted
distortion: to capture a viable photo of the target pattern, the defocused
camera must be temporarily brought into focus, as was done in
\figref{fig:plate-calibration}. This is not mentioned e.g. in the
application manual of Dantec's IPI system, but is a practical necessity.
Bringing a camera out of focus not only introduces a blur, it also scales the
image extents. \figref{fig:discrepancy}, adapted from \citet{Hardalupas10},
shows schematically how this effect creates ``center discrepancies''. Since the
extents of the defocused image are either smaller or larger than those of the
focused image, depending on the direction of defocusing, all droplet images are
projected either closer to or farther away from the image center. The
discrepancy is worst for droplets far away from the image center. As a result,
the centers of objects in simulatenously captured focused and defocused images
no longer align (\figref{fig:drop-calibration-off}), and the calibration
procedure becomes self-defeating.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/orb/discrepancy.pdf}
\caption{Schematic showing the source of center discrepancies in the case of
parallel image and object planes \label{fig:discrepancy}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.45\textheight]{img/orb/drop-calibration-off.jpg}
    \caption{Focused camera image, after applying homography $\mathbf{H}$
        derived from the calibration images, is superimposed onto
    defocused camera image of droplets. Discrepancies between object centers
grow towards the edge of the image.}
    \label{fig:drop-calibration-off}
\end{figure}

While this error is easy to account for in the ideal case of right angles and
perfect alignments (simply rescaling the image would solve the problem) the
situation becomes more difficult in practice when the target pattern is no longer
parallel to the camera sensor (intentionally or accidentally) or when
cylindrical lenses are used to add optical compression. In fact, there is no
guarantee that affine mappings are sufficient in the general case.

Surprisingly, only Hardalupas~\emph{et al.} \cite{Hardalupas10, Hardalupas10a}
have hitherto published a discussion of this effect, and the only previous
mention known to the authors is in \citet{Kurosawa02}, who dismissed it as a
``positioning error''.

Hardalupas \emph{et al.} identified the centers of particles in both PIV
(focused) and ILIDS (defocused) images. They then empirically estimated the
magnitude of the center discrepancy effect along the vertical axis, which
enabled them to improve the accuracy of their nearest-neighbour-based droplet
image matching algorithm.

We found that algorithms developed by the computer
vision community in recent years can obviate the need for calibration entirely.
Instead, we can use visual correspondences between the focused and defocused
images to find the mapping between them directly. To that end, we first provide
in \secref{sec:keypoint-review} a brief overview over popular methods in the field of automated (linear)
\emph{registration}, i.e. the art of finding a \emph{homography} (geometric
mapping) between two \emph{epipolar images} (images of the same object, taken
from different positions and angles). \secref{sec:keypoint-results} documents 
our approach in greater detail and shows the result of a successful
recalibration.

\subsection{Review of image registration techniques \label{sec:keypoint-review}} Given two
identical images that have been rotated, shifted or even scaled with respect to
one another, the applied transformation can theoretically be found by means of a
brute-force search. This method is not feasible in practice, not only because of
its enormous computational complexity (there are no gradients to guide the
search) but also because of its inability to deal with noise, focal blur,
perspective changes and other nonlinearities introduced by the photographic
process. Conversely, normalized cross-correlation measures between images, as
commonly used in PIV, are unaffected by noise but not invariant to rotation and
scale and therefore not generally practical. The standard approach to image
registration is therefore a three-step process. First, \emph{keypoints}, i.e.
``interesting'' points in the images are found by a keypoint detection
algorithm.  Then, a small image patch at every keypoint is extracted and
converted into a \emph{feature vector}, a set of numbers providing a very
general description of the image patch that accounts for scale, rotation, blur,
contrast, etc. Finally, matches between similar feature vectors from the two
images are found, outliers are removed, and the homography is calculated.

However, the results of a keypoint detection algorithm
must be as repeatable as possible, i.e. the same set keypoints should be found
in both images regardless of their relative position, rotation, scale, etc. 
For instance, the Harris corner detector \cite{Harris88}, one of the earliest
keypoint detectors, is sensitive to scale and thus often unusable.

The recent decade has seen a rapidly growing collection of proposed keypoint detectors,
beginning with \textsc{sift} \cite{Lowe04}, \textsc{surf} \cite{Bay08} and
\textsc{brisk} \cite{Leutenegger11}, all of which include keypoint extractors, to
\textsc{censure} \cite{Agrawal08}, optimized for speed, and
\textsc{fast} \cite{Rosten05}, which incorporates machine learning methods.
Finally, the recent publication of \textsc{orb} \cite{Rublee11} includes a
rotation-aware version of \textsc{fast} used in this paper. Many more have been
developed but are not included here for brevity's sake.

Keypoint extractors (sometimes called \emph{descriptors}) are often optimized
for and therefore included with keypoint detectors, as in the instances
mentioned above. Some however are standalone algorithms, such as
\textsc{brief} \cite{Calonder10}.

It is straightforward to find matching keypoints by searching for pairs
with the smallest arithmetic distance between their feature vectors (e.g. using the $L^2$ norm). This nearest-neighbour search
can be done exhaustively in linear time to find the optimal matching, but many
faster, if approximate, search methods exist. We should note \textsc{flann} \cite{Muja09},
a publicly available collection of such implementations which includes a fully
automatic parameter selection heuristic.

Finally, the homography, assuming one exists, can be derived from the set of
matched keypoint coordinate pairs. Since many of the found matches will be
wrong, it is of essence to use a robust estimator, i.e. a type of regression
model designed to ignore outliers. Possibly the oldest of these methods is
\textsc{ransac} \cite{Fischler81}, an iterative procedure in which sets of data points are
chosen at random and discarded if the agreement between a model fit to them and
all other data points falls below a carefully chosen threshold. \textsc{ransac} was used
for this paper, although other robust methods exist. The criterion developed by
\citet{Moisan04} deserves special mention in our context; it does away with
\textsc{ransac}'s hard threshold and instead takes into consideration the probability of
a match to be in consensus with epipolar geometry.

\subsection{Using affine oriented \textsc{fast}, \textsc{brief} and \textsc{ransac} to estimate the homography
between PIV and ILIDS photographs \label{sec:results}}

Existing PIV/ILIDS systems derive the homography from the result of a camera
calibration procedure which the user is required to perform before analyzing
images.
Although the final value of $\mathbf{H}$ is invisible to the user in our copy of
Dantec's DynamicStudio software, the camera matrices $\mathbf{P}_\text{foc}$ and
$\mathbf{P}_\text{def}$ can be shown and edited. We therefore must find a
corrected homography $\mathbf{\hat{H}}$ that allows us to compute
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\hat{P}}_\text{def} = \mathbf{\hat{H}} \, \mathbf{P}_\text{foc}
    \label{corrected-homography-use}
\end{equation}
so that we can replace $\mathbf{P}_\text{def}$ with $\mathbf{\hat{P}}_\text{def}$ in
the software, effectively correcting $\mathbf{H}$ to $\mathbf{\hat{H}}$.

To efficiently extract keypoints, we combined three algorithms:
\textsc{asift} \cite{Morel09} to deal with skew transformations; an oriented version of
\textsc{fast}, published as part of \textsc{orb}, to detect keypoints; and
standard \textsc{brief} as a keypoint extractor.

\textsc{asift} is a method originally developed to be used with \textsc{sift}.
It introduces invariance to affine mappings by simulating various
projective transformations while \textsc{fast} and \textsc{brief} are run repeatedly.
This slows the analysis down, but given the infinitude of
possible angled camera-camera-object configurations, it is wise to maintain a
flexible framework.

We should note that the original \textsc{asift} with
\textsc{sift} works well, but \textsc{sift} is encumbered by patents. To
encourage vendors of imaging systems to adopt the proposed algorithms, we made
it our goal to find a freely available replacement.

Recall that the disks in the defocused image are missing from the focused image,
rendering a registration between them impossible. It is straightforward to
simulate the disks, however. We followed the following protocol on our focused
images:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mask the image, blacking out all areas that are known not to contain
        droplets.
    \item Subtract the pixel-wise minimum or mean value taken over all images
        taken by the camera. This step serves to black out defective hot pixels
        on the camera's CCD and other static noise.
    \item Erode the image, using a $3\times 3$ or $5\times 5$ kernel. This will
        close any remaining bright pixels which are likely noise.
    \item Locate the intensity peaks in the remaining image.
    \item Fill a blank image with black, then draw bright circles of diameter
        $D_\text{disk}$ onto it, centerd at the respective positions of the
        intensity peaks detected in the focused image. (Note that simply dilating
        the result of the previous step will not lead to circular disks.)
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/orb/dilation.jpg}
    \caption{Simulating disks based on the focused image. \label{fig:making-disks}}
\end{figure}

The result of performing these operations on our sample image is shown in \figref{fig:making-disks}. We determined the disk diameter $D_\text{disk}$
empirically from the defocused images, although it is naturally preferable to
automate this step, e.g. using circular Hough transforms or cross-correlation
with circular masks. There may be simpler ways of achieving the same result,
e.g. by means of Gaussian filters, distance transforms and thresholding
operations. However, we found the protocol described above to be quite robust to
noise and fast enough for our application.

Implementations of \textsc{orb} and \textsc{brief} are freely available through
the OpenCV project, which provides bindings for the C++ and Python languages. We
used these implementations to find and extract matching keypoints between our
sample images, shown in \figref{fig:matching}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/orb/asift-matching.jpg}
    \caption{Visualized inliers in the set of matched keypoints between the
    mirrored simulated disks (see \figref{fig:making-disks}) and the ILIDS image. \label{fig:matching}}
\end{figure}

The matches shown in \figref{fig:matching} were found using a most basic
method: brute-force match search, followed by a \textsc{ransac} estimation of the
homography matrix $\mathbf{K}$ using a threshold of 10.

Since the two cameras were positioned behind a beamsplitter in our setup, the
defocused image was flipped horizontally. We therefore first mirrored it
horizontally, using the transformation matrix
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{M}_h = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
    -1 & 0 & \text{(image width)} \\
            0 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 1
    \end{array} \right].
\end{equation*}
To speed up the image registration process, it can be helpful to first down-scale the
images. To reduce an image to half of its original size, apply
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{S}_{0.5} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
    0.5 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0.5 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 1
    \end{array} \right].
\end{equation*}
While the above operations might not be strictly necessary, we found that they
significantly improved the quality of the matches identified.
If the registration algorithms mentioned above now find a homography matrix
$\mathbf{K}$, then we can write
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{K}\, \mathbf{M}_h\, \mathbf{S}_{0.5}\, \mathbf{P}_\text{foc} =
    \mathbf{S}_{0.5} \mathbf{P}_\text{def}
\end{equation}
and to bring this into a form similar to \eqref{homography-definition}, 
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{S}_{0.5}^{-1}\, \mathbf{K}\, \mathbf{M}_h\, \mathbf{S}_{0.5}\,
    \mathbf{P}_\text{foc} &=
     \mathbf{S}_{0.5}^{-1}\, \mathbf{S}_{0.5} \mathbf{P}_\text{def} \\
     &= \mathbf{P}_\text{def}
\end{align}

Finally, it turns out that Dantec's DynamicStudio software violates convention
by placing the coordinate origin at the bottom (not top) left corner of the
image. We must therefore pre- and post-multiply by $\mathbf{M}_v^{\pm 1}$, with
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{M}_v = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
            1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -1 & \text{(image height)} \\
            0 & 0 & 1
    \end{array} \right],
\end{equation*}
to arrive at our final expression for $\mathbf{\hat{H}}$:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\hat{H}} = \mathbf{M}_v\, \mathbf{S}_{0.5}^{-1}\, \mathbf{K}\,
    \mathbf{M}_h\, \mathbf{S}_{0.5}\, \mathbf{M}_v^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Substitution of $\mathbf{\hat{H}}$ into \eqref{corrected-homography-use} yields
$\mathbf{\hat{P}}_\text{def}$, which can be manually entered into the
DynamicStudio software. \figref{fig:drop-calibration-corrected} illustrates
how the use of $\mathbf{\hat{H}}$ leads to an improved alignment compared to
\figref{fig:drop-calibration-off}. Note that a slight projective distortion
is necessary for optimal registration, confirming that it is infeasible to restrict the homography
to affine matrices.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.45\textheight]{img/orb/drop-calibration-corrected.jpg}
    \caption{Focused camera image, after applying corrected homography
        $\mathbf{\hat{H}}$ derived from the matched keypoints, is superimposed onto
    defocused camera image of droplets.}

\end{figure}

\section{Removing center discrepancies with point set registration}
\label{sec:point-set-registration}
The keypoint matching approach described above is not applicable when a slit
aperture was used to reduce overlap, as in the paper by Hardalupas
\emph{et~al.}, so we will outline briefly how to use registration algorithms
with such setups.\footnote{While slit strip images could be
simulated over the focused image (in a procedure analogous to that illustrated
in \figref{fig:making-disks}), the lack of overlap between them could make it
significantly more difficult to find ``interesting'' keypoints in the simulated
image.}

Keypoints are not required, when the absence of overlap allows
us to identify focused and defocused objects centers directly from the respective
images and find a projection mapping between them. Indeed, Hardalupas
\emph{et~al.} successfully registered their PIV and ILIDS images that way: using
wavelet transforms at various frequencies, they identified the putative droplet
centers on both focused and defocused images.  Then, using a continuous,
single-stream monodisperse droplet generator, they estimated how the magnitude
of the center discrepancies varied over the image.  After applying this
empirically estimated distortion to the captured focused images, they matched each
focused droplet to the closest defocused droplet (if one could be found within an
subjectively chosen search distance).

Although they reported good success using this method, it requires both an
empirical estimation of the center discrepancies every time the camera is
defocused \emph{and} a guess at the appropriate search window size. Moreover,
mismatches are likely as the naive closest-neighbour search is not robust to
noise. To eliminate these steps, we suggest that droplet matches be found
directly using a robust point set registration algorithm.

Since the early 1990s, computer vision researchers have accumulated an
impressive body of work on this topic, most of it focusing either
on rigid transformations (i.e. translation and rotation only) or non-rigid
transformations (typically understood to include nonlinear warping). The problem
at hand requires an algorithm able to deal with projective transforms, which
are non-rigid but linear.

The only paper known to the authors to specifically address this case is by
\citet{Chi11}, who propose an iterative search based on image moments. Since
image moments are an aggregate metric, they do not directly lead to a
droplet-to-droplet correspondence. Still, closest-neighbour matches after
application of this algorithm would likely produce results no worse than those
found after estimating the transformation empirically.

Robust non-rigid methods are also applicable in this case and deserve some
mention. Many of them are probabilistic relaxations of the Iterative Closest
Point algorithm, which simply searches for the least-squares-optimal rigid
mapping. Several of these approaches were reviewed and generalized by
\citet{Jian10}. A slightly different approach, named Coherent Point
Drift\cite{Myronenko10}, is also highly popular and illustrated in \figref{fig:cpd}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/orb/pointset.eps}
    \caption{Non-rigid variant of the Coherent Point Drift algorithm applied to
    two point sets. Notice that the probabilistic nature of the matching creates
robustness to unmatched points. (Image source: Wikipedia)}
    \label{fig:cpd}
\end{figure}

We forgo at this point a documentation of the application and refer the reader to
Hardalupas \emph{et al.}, who describe their center identification technique in
good detail, and to the above-mentioned authors, who have published freely
available implementations of their algorithms online.

\section{Optical principle}
(Explanation)

\section{Sources of error}
\subsection{Gaussian beam divergence}
The theory predicting the linear relationship between detector phase difference
and droplet diameter is founded on the assumption of very small droplets and
plane beam wavefronts. \textbf{(Question: is it the wavefront curvature or the
non-uniformity of the intensity that causes problems?)}

The problem is termed \emph{trajectory ambiguity effect} (TAE) or \emph{Gaussian
beam defect} (GBD) in the literature.

This phenomenon was recognized first by \citet{Saffman86} but had to be neglected until
the plane-wave scattering theory of Lorenz-Mie optics was extended into
the \emph{Generalized Lorenz-Mie Theory} (GLMT). Most of this work was
done by Gouesbet, Gréhan, Maheu, Lock and others throughout the 1980s
\cite{Grehan80, Gouesbet82, Gouesbet88, Maheu88}, and mathematically
rigorous formulations were available by the early 1990s \cite{Lock94,
Gouesbet94}. The 1996 paper by Gouesbet and Gréhan summarizes these developments
and provides an early overview over the attempts to circumvent the TAE
\cite{Gouesbet96}. More discussion is given e.g. by 

Solutions are a) a planar setup, b) double-burst measurements, c) epsilon
validity measurements. It is important to align the receiver properly; the
tables used by TSI were developed using GLMT by \citet{Naqwi96}.

\subsection{Slit effect}
Durst et al show experimentally that the slit effect is even more crucial than
the Gaussian beam effect. \cite{Durst94}. Together with the TAE, this
is called the measurement volume effect. Qiu and Hsu propose using four
detectors, instead of three, to resolve this problem entirely \cite{Qiu99}. A
similar design was verified experimentally by \citet{Sipperley14}.

A more recent review of the phenomenon and associated techniques was given by
\citet{Strakey00, Strakey01}.

\subsection{Change in fringe frequency over $z$}
The curved wavefront causes the fringe spacing to vary along the axis of the
measurement volume. At the near and far ends of the volume, the fringes are
spaced wider, which can result in an error on the order of 10\%. (Red Book)

\subsection{Selection of lenses and masks}
Davis and Disimile talk about the TAE only tangentially. They provide results of
the same spray using different masks and focal lengths \cite{Davis04}.

\subsection{Optical aberrations}
See \citet{Dressler90}.

\subsection{Wrongly entered parameters}
The optical principle involves many more geometric parameters than are needed
for the operation of ILIDS or laser diffraction (Malvern) devices. As a result, an
excellent interface and a very attentive user are required to ensure accurate
results.

In practice, I always get error messages when doing the last step, and the
values are way out of the expected range. The result, then, is that the D20 is
made very close to the expected monodisperse diameter. Since the D20 is quite
a bit larger than the actual (and completely obvious) peak value, even these
"wrong" values aren't correct.

\section{Calibration}
Calibration is tricky, because 

knowndiam = argmax(gaussian(average(diamAB[within7percent], diamAC[within7percent])))

Since the selection of droplets with <=diff(diam) and the gaussian kernel
density estimate are one-way functions, it's impossible to work backwards. We
also want to minimize the angle in the difference-diameter plot, i.e. the PCA is
supposed to be as close as possible to 0 and 90 degrees. So the only way to do
this reliably is to iterate over the two AB and AC values to find an optimum.

Nonetheless, even with this method the relationship between the distance values
AB and AC is typically linear, and once the linear relationship has been found,
we can find the combination of values that produces the most straight PCA and
the most centered cluster. Let's approximate the

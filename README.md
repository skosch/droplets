Droplets
========

Much of the material in this repo constitutes the basis for my MASc thesis, written sometime between 2013 and 2015 at the [Ashgriz lab](http://mussl.mie.utoronto.ca) in Toronto.

Most of the scattered files you see here have been compiled into the following three documents:

* **papers/hdg.pdf** – preprint of [A simple vibrating orifice monodisperse droplet generator using a hard drive actuator arm](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/rsi/86/4/10.1063/1.4916703), published in *Review of Scientific Instruments*, 2015.
* **papers/orb.pdf** — preprint of [Eliminating center discrepancies between simultaneously captured ILIDS and PIV images by means of direct homography estimation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026322411630433X), published in *Measurement*, Dec 2016.
* **thesis.pdf** — my thesis document, containing much of the above two papers, plus a bunch of other stuff.
